# Introduction

This is the *plan de campagne* (plan of action, Dutch: plan van aanpak)
for my end-of-study internship. I am Carmen Bianca Bakker, and follow a
bachelor in software engineering (Dutch: informatica) at NHL Stenden
University of Applied Sciences. My internship is at Liferay
International Ltd. in Dublin, a daughter company of Liferay Inc. in the
United States. The companies will henceforth be referred to as simply
"Liferay". The internship lasts approximately 5 months between 3
February 2020 and 30 June 2020. My job title at Liferay is "Paralegal
Engineering Intern".

The plan de campagne will detail the context of the internship, the
problem that I was brought in to solve, the research that will be
conducted to TODO, the project that will be undertaken, and the planning
to bind everything together.

TODO: The shortest possible summary of the internship here.

TODO: Summarise each chapter individually.
